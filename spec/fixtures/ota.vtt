00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:01.900
I'm James Smith.

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:03.500
I'm here at St.

3
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.000
John's Hoxton in London for

4
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.800
Over The Air 2016.

5
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.800
And I've just finished doing a

6
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.700
talk this morning about

7
00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:11.800
open source democracy

8
00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:13.800
in the network age.

9
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.300
So about how we can use ideas

10
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.800
from open source,

11
00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.100
online collaboration,

12
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.600
and so on to build a better

13
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.200
democracy for

14
00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.300
our future in the age

15
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.800
of the Internet and of

16
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.300
universal connectivity.

17
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.700
At the moment we're operating

18
00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.500
with the institutions and

19
00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.600
parties of the industrial

20
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.200
revolution.

21
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.300
The network revolution,

22
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.500
which is really just beginning,

23
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.200
will change all of that.

24
00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.000
It changes our society and it

25
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.800
will have to change the

26
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.400
institutions as well.

27
00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.000
So we're trying

28
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.300
to build new experiments

29
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:50.900
for that age.

30
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.400
I run an open source

31
00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.900
startup political party called

32
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.700
Something New here in the UK.

33
00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.100
We have an open source

34
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.000
manifesto and we stood

35
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.100
in the 2015 General Election

36
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.100
on that manifesto.

37
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.000
We are looking for more

38
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.900
people to get involved.

39
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.600
If you're dissatisfied with the

40
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.400
current state of politics;

41
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.300
if you feel that the world is

42
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.900
not going in the direction that

43
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.600
you believe it should be;

44
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.500
if you believe in an optimistic

45
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.500
future where humanity

46
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.300
can be amazing then

47
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.400
we want to build that and we

48
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.100
need your help. If you are a

49
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.800
developer or a

50
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.100
UX designer or a community

51
00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.400
manager or media or

52
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.100
anything at all or you just

53
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:35.800
have ideas.

54
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.500
It's all about building

55
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.300
something together.

56
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.300
And we can do

57
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.200
with your help; let's build the

58
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.000
future. Come and visit us at
